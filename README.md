Lista com as perguntas e respostas que eu fiz do exerc√≠cio

# Why is testing considered an 'optimistic' verification technology?

`You can use testing on any kind of software, whereas you can only run static analysis or proofs on small systems.`

# If a test fails, it could mean:

- `The program is incorrect`
- `The test itself is incorrect`

# Suppose we have two systems A and B, and A is more rigorously tested than B.  Does System A better meet its quality goals than System B?

`no`

# Unit test is used to test: (choose best answer)

`User initial requirements.`

# 'Service' is the system behavior as defined by the software requirements.

`True`

# A latent error becomes an effective error when

`The error causes the program to return something unexpected to the user.`

# Does a program terminating with an error always indicate a failure?

`No`

# Adaptive cruise control software that continues to run in the presence of multiple hardware and service failures but regularly misjudges the distance between cars by a substantial amount is an example of a ______ system.

`certainly reliable`

# Mutation testing is a _______ metric

`white-box`

# Which of the following are true about testing? Check all that apply.


- `It documents system behavior.`
- `It is difficult to do rigorously.`
- `It can sometimes find errors that are not actively looked for, when (for example) a program crashes during execution of a test case.`

# Tasks that can be part of the Tear Down phase are (choose two answers):

- `Remove data you added after testing is done.`
- `Close connection after testing is done.`

# In the JUnit test framework, we write test cases (choose the best answer):

`in a separate class, and for each method in the program we associated a test case(s) to test the correctness of the method.`

# Concurrent systems are quite difficult to test because (choose the best answer):

`All of the above`
